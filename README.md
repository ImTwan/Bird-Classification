# Bird-Classification
The dataset including the images for the train and test text files is too large, so I cannot upload it on GitHub. For further details about the requirements for the Bird Classification,
you can view the Assignment Requirements.pdf file. For the explanation for the code and for the project, view the Assignment Report.pdf file. 

The dataset for the Bird Classification is in this Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lcTw5YuiHIYj-kABplIOiq3u5aZ21s6i?usp=sharing

Make Sure you unzip the zip files.
